  <p>  Congratulations to those of you who can read the text next.
This is 2048(just want to point out in case people in the future will read these). The world is becoming uncontrollable. There are wars, fires everywhere. People have nowhere to escape the chaotic government who inspects their daily lives. The spiritual “wastes” are banned by the Gov, including many distinguished  poems, novels, paintings, songs etc. Most public art pieces are burned or removed also. In order to keep some of the human legacy, we established this secret base in 2045. In this place, people can enrich their minds and share ideas freely.

    It is the abnormal things let we realized how ridiculous the world is.Due to the lack of spiritual freedom, many people committed suicide and bunch of names showed in the newspaper everyday. A lot of people still are unaware that they are gradually losing the sensation of feeling love, or feeling the environments around them. Therefore, we named the store “Beloved”, to call back their primitive ability inside the bodies. The bookstore is not open to the public, only invitees can be allowed to enter. But the “public” still can read our zines (twice per year).
